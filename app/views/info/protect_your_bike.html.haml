          Cable locks should never be used as a primary means of locking a bike in a city.

        Aim to have the hardest bike to steal on the bike rack. We consider two U-locks, or one U-lock and one heavy duty cable to be the minimum required in large cities to keep a bike secure.

        Don't rely on foot traffic to keep your bike safe; years of reports have taught us that many thefts, particularly those involving cutting cable locks, occur under the cover of crowd activity or in front of bustling cafés or restaurants.

        Don't rely on the presence of cameras to keep your bike secure. Security footage is rarely of much use once a bike is gone, and thieves know this.

        Cheaper and older U-locks can often be defeated with common hand tools, or no tools at all.

        Signposts can be removed from the ground by unbolting them. Some are already unattached. Do not lock to signposts without first checking to make sure they can't be easily removed.

        Many bicycles are stolen from garages and store rooms. Lock your bike securely to an immovable object even if in a "secure" place.
