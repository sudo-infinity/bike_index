We built the bike index because of everyones fatalistic response to bike theft. We designed it like we did because we were trying to create the best way to fight bike theft and create the best registry- one that was convenient, easty to uses and that people would register with before their bikes were stolen.

Is the idea of registering a Bikes a good one?

We think so. There are many cool devices out there (like the [Bike Spike](http://bikespike.com/) and [Helios Bars](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/kennygibbs/helios-bars-transform-any-bike-into-a-smart-bike)) that allow you to track your bike, but without some central place to save verified information about your bike, a lot of their utility is lost.

The Biking community is amazing and biking itself creates community. We're all incredibly happy to participate in that community, and want to give something back. We believe that given the opportunity to conveniently search for stolen bikes, bike riders will check out any suspicious bikes and hesitate beofre buying a used bike--thereby making it more difficult to sell stolen bikes, and making bike theft less common.

Additionally, by creating verified records, we make it easier to file crime reports and insurance claims.

  After telling hundreds of customers, "you should register with your local police department" (knowing few of them would, and it wouldn't mean much if they did), the Bike Index founders had an idea: a nationwide, easy to use, searchable bike registry. Were this to exist, it

    would
  mean something.

  And so they built it.

Police seargant here in the tenderloin. Joe McCloskey
Set's up stings to catch bike thieves in the act

Nobody went to jail. they uh, we're on probation, got their probation modified, it's not a high priority crime.

Seargant McCloskey  doesn't see that changing anytime soon. So for now, the stolen bike economy will continue to thrive, just out of site.

Bike index is a national, publicly-accessible bike registration service that gives bike shops the ability to quickly and easily register bikes for their customers.

Each year over a million bikes are stolen in the United States

but we don't know exactly how many. 1
1,000,000 *

But we could figure it out. We could do a much better job of keeping track of bikes: they all come with unique serial numbers. We just need to keep track of them.

Who better to keep track of bikes than the people who sell and work on them?

According to FBI statistics, 206,053 bikes were reported stolen in 2010, the most recent available year with data. An estimated 9 in 10 incidents of bike theft go unreported. That's a lot of bikes! What’s more: reporting bike theft is sometimes actively discouraged by the police. If you would like to read more about bike theft in the US, check out Priceonomics' exploration of the topic.

Bike theft is a big problem. It's expensive, heartbreaking and most important to us, a deterrent to biking. (in urban centers where biking is a fast and plausible transportation alternative).

We believe this service will benefit the cycling community and deter bike theft. **Welcome to the Bike Index**.

We built the type of service we'd want to register bikes with. We hope you do too.

We provide a way for bike owners to verify that they own a bike&mdash;so if they sell it, they can provide proof of ownership. And if they ever lose the bike, they can accurately and easily report the theft to the police and file an insurance claim.


We've been busy building the best place to save your bike.

So signup. Find a shop that registers bikes for the Bike Index.

And never lose track of your trusty steed.


Our pricing is simple: You pay a bike shop $5 to register your bike. We charge the bike shop $1 for each bike they register. There are no set-up fees for shops, each month they simply pay for the bikes they've registered.

National, publicly searchable, proof of ownership. In case of theft, insurance claim. Selling your bike. Only 9$ to register
for permanent.

Bike theft sucks. It's expensive, heartbreaking and a major barrier to bike commuting. (references)

Bicycles in good operating condition with quality components are the most efficient transportation machines that exist. But poorly maintained, low quality bikes aren't (references). Because of the ever present risk of theft (especially in large cities) people are nervous about investing in their bikes and are constantly worried whenever they leave their presence.

Bike theft is profitable because it's easy to sell stolen bikes. Non-criminals with good intentions buy them because they don't know they were someone's lovely steed previously.

Don't buy someone's lovely steed!



# What is the Bike Index?

Bike theft is a problem in the biking community. There are millions of bikes stolen each year. And the only advice people give to avoid having your bike stolen is to try to make your bike a less appealing steal than the bike next to yours.

There are a lot of reasons why bike theft happens, but a big part of it is because it's easy and there are essentially no consequences for it. And selling stolen bikes is also easy and common and there are essentially no repercussions there either.

It's tough to know for sure if a questionable bike or part is actually stolen, and so it's far too easy to justify purchasing questionable bike parts and bikes.

Existing stolen registries are a start, but it's not enough to only report your bike when it's stolen. Far too often bike owners with stolen bikes don't remember important information about the bikes they've lost. Which makes it tough to report the theft accurately. Additionally it's difficult to trust things written on the internet, to move to action based on anonymous internet content. And it's not comfortable to post your contract information publicly on the internet.

But if you want to have any hope of getting your bike back, you have to be able to be contacted.

The way to combat this is to motivate someone to register bikes, to verify their ownership and to create a network of concerned parties who can work to register bikes and who have an interest in ensuring bike ownership. The police can't do this, and without some group who cares about registering bikes, it's far too easy for the whole thing to fall apart.

Who better to assume the role of bike protector than local bike shops? They are already a center of the cycling community. They already see most bikes. And they know and care about them.

So: to add your bike to the index you have to stop by your local shop. It they aren't one of our partners yet, ask them to contact us. We'd love to sign them up.

It's $5 to register a bike, and then the bike is registered forever. You can edit all the attributes of your bike (except for the manufacturer and serial) to show off how cool your bike is, and upload pictures of the bike too. And if you ever sell or trade the bike to someone else, you can send your index entry to the new owner for free.

If your bike is ever stolen you can mark it as stolen in the index, alerting anyone who looks it up, and add your contact information so that bike shops can quickly contact you. We hide your information from anyone who isn't a shop employee. But the ability to call you is incredibly vital, and what makes this convenient for bike shops. If they can contact you as soon as they see your bike they can actually take action.

We also want any stolen bike to be findable on the index. So even if you haven't registered your bike and it's stolen, you can add it to the index for free.

Please, if you have a stolen bike, add it to the index. Even if it's not a verified bike, it will make people think twice before stealing it.
