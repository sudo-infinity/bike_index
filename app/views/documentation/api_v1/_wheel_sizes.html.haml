  The International Organization for Standardization has a universal tire sizing system that removes the confusion surrounding wheel and tire sizes - read 
  = link_to "Sheldon Brown's article on tire sizing", "http://sheldonbrown.com/tire-sizing.html#iso"
  to learn more.

%p
  We use BSD (Bead Seat Diameter) to identify wheel sizes. This is the second number in the pair of numbers found on tires (e.g. the numbers on a 700 x 23 tire are 23-622 - so the BSD is 622).

%p
  You can get the list of BSD's we accept by querying our API.
