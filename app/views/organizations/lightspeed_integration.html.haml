    Lightspeed Retail integration

      We believe bike registration is incredibly important. While we can't guarantee a registered bike will be recovered if it's stolen, it's very unlikely that one that isn't registered will be.
    %p
      So it makes sense to protect your customers right when you sell them a bike &mdash; and we designed the Index to be a great way for bike shops to register bikes for their customers.
    %p
      If you register a bike for someone, they receive an email with the basic information about their bike. If they choose to, they can sign in to the Bike Index and edit, update or mark the bike stolen.
    .alert
      We will not send your customers any email other than the registration email. We will never trade or sell their email to anyone.

      I started the Bike Index because I wanted to register bikes for my customers at the shop where I worked &mdash; with this integration, we're finally able to give shops a way to register bikes that doesn't interfere with selling them.

      Setting up the integration is easy:
    %ol
      - unless current_user.present? && current_user.memberships.present?
        %li
          %p
            Add your organization to the Bike Index (<a href="#add_organization" class="scroll-to-ref">below</a>)
      %li
        %p
          - if current_user.present? && current_user.memberships.count > 0
            - org = current_user.organizations.first
            Go to the
            %a{ href: "https://pos_integration.bikeindex.org/organizations/connect?id=#{org.slug}&access_token=#{org.access_token}"}
              Lightspeed Retail Integration
          - else
            Click on the Lightspeed Retail Integration button (at the bottom of the page for your organization once you've signed up).
            
      %li
        %p
          Click on "integrate with the Bike Index" and follow the steps with Lightspeed Retail to connect your account.
    
    %p.padded
      And that's it. Every bike you sell will automatically be registered, so long as you put in the customer's email and the bike has a serial number in the "serial number" field in Lightspeed.
    %p
      If a customer doesn't want to be registered, put "do not register" in the notes for the sale and we won't register the bike.
    
    .alert
      %p
        We will not register any bikes that were sold before you signed up for the integration.
      %p
        You will be able to see these bikes in the Lightspeed Integration page and register them there if you choose to.
      / %p
      /   You can register these bikes by clicking edit, checking the "register despite issues" checkbox, and clicking the "Update bike" button. If you'd like to register a large quantity, #{link_to "contact us", "mailto:seth@bikeindex.org"}.
