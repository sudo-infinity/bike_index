      The Bike Index gives you the ability to quickly and easily register bikes for your customers or members.
    %p
      When you register a bike, your customer will receive an email with the basic information about the bike &mdash; they never need to do anything else, and they will always have a permanent record of their bike.
    %p
      If they ever want to, they can sign in to Bike Index and upload photos or add details, and if their bike is stolen, they can mark it stolen on the Index to get the best chance of recovery.

            Does your bike shop use LightSpeed Cloud? We offer an integration to make bike registration entirely automatic at your shop.
          %p
            Make sure every bike you sell is registered, so that every one of your customers' bikes are protected, regardless of how busy your shop is (#{link_to 'read the announcement', 'https://bikeindex.org/blogs'}).

              What if a customer doesn't want to be registered?
            %p
              Just put "do not register" in the notes section of the bike when you sell it (or don't take the customer's email).

            %p
              We need your #{link_to 'LightSpeed Cloud API key', 'http://lightspeed.com/api_key'}. We are working on a video tutorial to show how to get exactly what we need, but for now, just
              %a{ href: 'mailto:contact@bikeindex.org' }
                contact us
              and we'll get you set up.
