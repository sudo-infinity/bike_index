          Bike Index is a comprehensive public database - if your bike was stolen, we think everyone should know about it.

          Visit the #{link_to "stolen bikes page", stolen_bikes_url} to for more information, or #{link_to "add a stolen bike here", new_bike_url(stolen: true)}.

    %dd#what-about-privacy.collapse
      %p
        Your personal information is never viewed, shared or sold without your permission.
      %p
        Bikes are public and searchable, but no information about the owner is visible. You can choose to share information (such as your twitter or personal website) but this is turned off by default.

        How does this prevent bike theft?
    %dd#does-this-prevent-theft.collapse
      %p
        Right now people with good intentions buy stolen bikes because there isn't a single searchable, simple resource to check before buying a bike.
      %p
        Bike Index is that resource. The next time you buy a used bike, check the Index first.
      %p
        We also offer bike shops and law enforcement an easy to use interface to look up any suspicious bikes they encounter, and a way to quickly contact the proper owner.
      / %p
      /   We are starting the our battle battle against bike thieves and selling stolen bikes, but are by no means finished.
      / Bike Index won't make bike theft go away over night, but with the biking communities support we will have a place to start.
