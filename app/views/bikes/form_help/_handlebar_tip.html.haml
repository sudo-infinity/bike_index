        Flat bars
      are the most common style of bars. They are generally perpendicular the bike's wheel and have grips that are more or less flat to the ground. They may actually have up to 40Â° backsweep or a bend so that the center is lower than the grips. Some examples of flat bars are straight bars and riser bars.

        Forward facing bars
      have ends that point forward, away from the seat (some flat bars have attachments to this effect, but those don't count here). Some examples of forward facing include bullhorns, time-trial bars and pursuit bars.

        Rear facing bars
      have ends that point backward, toward the seat. Some examples of rear facing bars are cruiser bars, ape-hangers and mustache bars.

        No handlebars
      are any bikes without handlebars and handlebars that don't fit the above categories.  For example, unicycles often don't have handlebars, and recumbents sometimes have under-the-seat bars.
