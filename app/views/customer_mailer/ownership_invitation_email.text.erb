--------------------------------

* Protect your bike by following these locking guidelines. *

- Use a U-Lock. Cable locks should never be used as a primary means of locking a bike in a city.

- Secure both wheels - either with two U-locks, or one U-lock and one heavy duty cable.

- Do not lock to anything without first checking to make sure it can't be easily removed.
