      Help us fight bicycle theft &mdash; one registration at a time.
    
    %h3
      The Bike Index makes stolen bikes harder to sell and easier to recover by making sure important information about your bike is there when you need it the most.
    %h3
      So far we've registered #{number_with_delimiter(Bike.count)} bikes and recovered over #{number_with_delimiter(StolenRecord.recovered.where("date_recovered < ?", Time.zone.now.beginning_of_day).count)} stolen bikes.
    %h3
      The process is simple, secure, and free.
